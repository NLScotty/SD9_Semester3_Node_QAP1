// This program is my http program, but instead written with express instead of HTTP.
// One can see how express is a much cleaner way of accomplishing the same thing, and offers
// additional opportunites to segregate our code into other files.

//required for express
const express = require('express');

// Creates an express server
const server = express();
// We  expect an incomming form, thus we can parse the response with the code below
// Speciffically used in post requests.
server.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}));

// Handles our post request. It has two arguments; the url and a function that runs when the endpoint is called.
// One would normally further seggregate this by having the function in a seperate file, but for this sample I
// have it placed here. Also note how easy it is to get the request data (no playing with a loop required).
server.post('/',(req,res) => {
    let body ='';

// Handles our get request. 
server.get('/',(req,res) => {
